# Introduction
I am an aspiring Java developer,  so I have been checking few udemy courses and doing some to assess my understanding.  This was part of the course a was doing on udemy called [spring boot tricks](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=2807757) by [Azadi Bogolugov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azadibogolubov).  This introduced me to several topics which are important for a springboot beginner, namely: custom annotations, MVCTest, difference between model and entity,  JDBC and database connection.  I must also explain that I used PostgreSQL instead of Mysql this is because MySQL seems to be so easy to understand compared to PostgreSQl.  

I would like to grow further if you ever come across this Repo and feel like there's something you think I should learn please shout out and give me ideas.

# THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF MY JOURNEY.  **wish me luck**
